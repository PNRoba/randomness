Code files:<br />
Formula - calculates results from LIL formula and stores them in .txt files<br />
Diagrams - to visualise data in 100 mil chunks<br />
Last 51 chars - to print last 51 digits of the constant (to compare to y-cruncher fragments if the last digits are correct)<br />
Counter - counts occurance of each digit (for constants that contain the integer part and radix point)<br />
Counter Pi - counter for pi (counted in parts and is without integer part and radix point)<br />
<br />
